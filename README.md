## Introduction

This is a rather old course, but cause the basic idea behind computer graphics did not change that much, it is still a good start for anyone interested in that. (And it's not that easy to get access to the high-quality course material even now.)

What will you do in the course..

- In assignment 0, you will get to know more about the self-similar fractals.
- In assignment 1-4, you will get a basic ray tracer!
- Assignment 5-7 will give your program more speed and higher quality.
- Assignment 8 focuses on the curve, and 9 give your the chance to implemented a particle system!



## Let's Get Started!

### > Start the project on your own..

This repository may help save you some time downloading the code file or slides.

The code lies in [**lectures**](Original Files\lectures) while the slides in [**tasks**](Original Files\tasks).

If you are interested in this project, **PR welcome**!



### > If you need some base code..

I plan to put all the home work into one solution. I plan to leave some blank that student can easily "fill in" instead of write the whole structure.

Now I only finish the first five project. It's temporary in [**My Result**](My Result) now.

>  Visual studio 2017
>
>  配置属性-调试-命令参数
>
>  Add glut32.dll to execute folder (start from assignment3)
>
>  If a function has assert(0) - this function should be pure virtual, but cause in previous assignment need to instance such abstract class, I leave it this way.
>
>  Rebuild the project when change startup project (this is a bad design in the code, I generate the mid result in same folder)
